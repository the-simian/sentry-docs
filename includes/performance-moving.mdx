<Note>

The Performance landing page is moving to <a href="/product/insights/frontend/" target="_blank">Insights &rsaquo; Frontend</a>,  <a href="/product/insights/backend/" target="_blank">Insights &rsaquo; Backend</a>, <a href="/product/insights/mobile/" target="_blank">Insights &rsaquo; Mobile</a>, and
 <a href="/product/insights/ai/" target="_blank">Insights &rsaquo; AI</a>.
 
Don't worry! It's the same Performance you know and love, just fine-tuned to each of these domains. Picture a 1964
Pontiac GTO, but it's a presentation layer on top of your span data.
